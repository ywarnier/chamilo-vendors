# chamilo-vendors
Proxy repository for all the dependencies chamilo-lms must have.

This is meant to generate the final version of vendor libraries needed for your development version of Chamilo, to put in the vendor/ and web/ directories + the composer.lock file.

At this point, the contents of this repository are generated manually from a computer where Chamilo dependencies are properly updated through Composer.
